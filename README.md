# MiterSlotRunner
STL generator for miter slots

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3973092

Created a simple generator for a miter slot track. Requires OpenSCAD to generate the STLs.

Designed for:
1/4" x 20 Hex Nut or Bolt

I found I had problems with the original design was that the nut could rotate out of alignment and also really short so it was a bit of difficult to install accurately.
I also didn't like the adjustable ones available since it didn't have the lip for the groove.

The generator uses OpenSCAD to create the STL if you need different dimensions.
It is parameterized for easy changes such as slot width/height/length and screw/nut cutouts.

I've included different lengths in STL that can be used based on the size of your sled.
Shortest length is useful for testing slot fit.

STLs were printed for DeWALT DWE7491RS
